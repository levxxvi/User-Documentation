### Adding a customized Discord Bot

| :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `My server does not show up when I try to add my discord bot`       | :material-check:     Ensure that the manage server permission is enabled in your server. If you were not the person who created the server, you must have this permission enabled to be able to add a discord bot to the server. Ensure that the server owner enables this permission for moderators or members who are allowed to add bots to the server. By default, if you were the server creator, this will be enabled.  |
| `Discord bot replies are very delayed or slow` | :material-check-all: Otherwise, there simply may just be very high traffic on discord's network which may be causing this delay. If the issue does not resolve, attempt to kick the bot and re-invite to the server.
